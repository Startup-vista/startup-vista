          <div className="space-y-6 text-[#2E2E2E] pt-12">
            <p>
              Every great company starts with a challengeâ€”and ours was simple:
            </p>
            <p className="font-bold text-[#1C4BC6]">
              Startups were doing amazing things, but no one knew about them.
            </p>
            <p>
              While working closely with early-stage founders and startup teams, we realized that many were building impactful products, raising funds, and making big movesâ€”but their stories rarely reached the people who mattered: customers, media, partners, and especially investors.
            </p>
            <p>
              The traditional media spotlight was limited. Social media was noisy and fleeting. And unless you were already well-funded or famous, your startup's milestones often went unnoticed.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, we created StartupVista â€” a platform that lets startups showcase their journey, achievements, and vision, in their own words, to the right audience. A place where updates turn into visibility, visibility turns into trust, and trust opens doors to growth.
